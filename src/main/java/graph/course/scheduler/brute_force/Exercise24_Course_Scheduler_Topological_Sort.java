/**
 * Given a N number of course and list of tuple of prerequisites, find if it is
 * possible to end all courses (boolean answer)
 * 
 * N represent the course labeled from 0 to N-1
 * 
 * The list of course prerequisites is an array of tuples, where the second
 * value in the tuple represent the prerequisite of the course which is the
 * first value. (this is a directed edge), so we would have a directed graph
 * 
 * Using a topological sort we can reduce the time complexity from the brute
 * force approach from O(p + n ^3) to O(p + n ^2)
 * 
 * Topological sort consist in identify those vertexes that have in indegree (the
 * number of edges pointing to this vertex) of zero. We remove those vertexes (one
 * at a time), put it values into a indegree array and subtract one (reduce by
 * one the indegree of those vertexes) to those vertexes to which theses vertexes
 * points to, and repeat again until the we remove all the vertexes in the graph,
 * ending with the indegree array filled with all the vertex in the graph.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * This graph 
 * 
 * 		   5     4
 * 		    \  / \
 *           ><   >
 * 		  2	  0   1
 *         \  |
 *          > V
 *            3
 * indegree of each vertex
 * 
 * 0: 2 (5 and 4 points to him)
 * 1: 1 (4 points to him)
 * 2: 0 (nobody points to him)
 * 3: 2 (0 and 2 points to him)
 * 4: 0 (nobody points to him)
 * 5: 0 (nobody points to him)
 * 
 * 1 -We have 3 possible starting points (4,5 o 2) which have zero indegree.
 * 
 * 		   5    4
 * 		    \  / \
 *           ><   >
 * 		  2	  0   1		indegree matrix = []
 *         \  |			indegree value =   0 => 2
 *          > V							   1 => 1
 *            3							   2 => 0
 *            							   3 => 2
 *            							   4 => 0
 *            							   5 => 0
 * 
 * 2 -We chose 4 for example, remove it from the graph,add it value to the indegree
 * array and substract one from vertex 0 and 1.
 * 
 *    	   5     
 * 		    \    
 *           >    
 * 		  2	  0   1		indegree matrix = [4]
 *         \  |         indegree value =   0 => 1
 *          > V							   1 => 0
 *            3							   2 => 0
 *            							   3 => 2
 *            							   4 => 0
 *            							   5 => 0
 *  
 * 3 -Now we take vertex 2, remove it, added to the indegree array and subtract one
 * from vertex 3.
 * 
 *    	   5     
 * 		    \    
 *           >    
 * 		   	  0   1		indegree matrix = [4,2]
 *            |			indegree value =   0 => 1         
 *            V							   1 => 0
 *            3							   2 => 0
 *            							   3 => 1
 *            							   4 => 0
 *            							   5 => 0
 * 
 * 4 -Now we take vertex 1, remove it, added to the indegree array and because 
 * vertex 1 has no edges to any vertex we don´t subtract from any vertex   
 * 
 *    	   5     
 * 		    \    
 *           >    
 * 		   	  0   		indegree matrix = [4,2,1]
 *            |			indegree value =   0 => 1         
 *            V							   1 => 0
 *            3							   2 => 0
 *            							   3 => 1
 *            							   4 => 0
 *            							   5 => 0
 *            
 * 5 - We take 5, remove it from the graph, added to the indegree array and subtract
 * 1 from vertex 0.           
 *
 *  		  0   		indegree matrix = [4,2,1,5]
 *            |			indegree value =   0 => 0         
 *            V							   1 => 0
 *            3							   2 => 0
 *            							   3 => 1
 *            							   4 => 0
 *            							   5 => 0
 * 
 * 
 * 6 - We take vertex 0, remove it from the graph, added to the indegree array and subtract
 * 1 from vertex 3. 
 * 
 * 
 * 			     		indegree matrix = [4,2,1,5,0]
 *            			indegree value =   0 => 0         
 *             							   1 => 0
 *            3							   2 => 0
 *            							   3 => 0
 *            							   4 => 0
 *            							   5 => 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 7 - Finally we take vertex 3
 * 
 *  			     	indegree matrix = [4,2,1,5,0,3]            			
 * 
 * 
 * Topological Sort only works when there is no cycles in the graph. The reason
 * is that if a cycle exist when you remove a node with indegree value of zero,
 * where the cycle exists all the vertexes will remain with a indegree greater 
 * than zero, so the algorithm with not go further. So if the algorithm iterate
 * the number of vertex in the graph, but could´t touch everyone, we have a cycle.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 
 * 1 - Can we have courses unconnected to other courses. Yes, account for
 * separate course chains. We can have courses that has no relation with other
 * courses, so each chain can be taken by the student in different orders
 * without any prerequisite conflict.
